We have implemented most of the functionality of Minesweeper, including
all of the core mechanics, difficulty selection, restarting, automatic
space clearing, flagging, reporting to the user the number of mines and
flags on the board, and win/loss detection (and reporting of that to
the user). Some additional features we are hoping to implement for the
final version include a timer/score mechanism, dynamic scaling based
on the window size, and UI/graphical changes.

To run the project, use elm reactor and navigate to Grid.elm.
